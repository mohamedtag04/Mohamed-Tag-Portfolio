          Hey! I'm Mohamed Tag. I'm a Computer Science student with a deep passion for Data Science, AI, and Software Development.
          I’m naturally curious, always eager to learn, and thrive on solving complex problems. Whether it's building machine learning models, writing clean
          and efficient code, or exploring new technologies, I’m all in. I believe that great ideas come from diverse perspectives, which is why I enjoy working
          with people from different backgrounds. Right now, I’m focused on applying my knowledge to real-world projects, continuously improving my skills, and 
          pushing myself beyond my comfort zone.
